# developerWorks horoscope service UI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/`
directory. If you want to deploy the app to a web server, use `ng build --prod
--build-optimizer`.
If you're doing to deploy the app anywhere other than the root directory
of your server, add the `--base-href=./` argument - that tells the `index.html`
file to look in
the current directory for all of its dependencies. (Which should work...if it
doesn't, try setting the path explicitly, as in `--base-href=./horoscope`.)

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
